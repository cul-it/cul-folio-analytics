Pulled from MetaDB on 1/8/25

CULâ€™s physical materials collections comprises of almost 10 million items. For purposes of reporting (both internally and externally),
counts of these physical items are often grouped into formats such as books, serials, visual materials, etc. This table provides 
multiple suggested ways to group format counts based on MARC coding. These translations have been carefully reviewed and agreed upon
by CUL cataloging subject matter experts as well as by reporting experts.
