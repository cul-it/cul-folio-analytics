BD/ILL Counts

This report consists of two separate queries. 

1. The first one provides a count of BD and ILL loans from CUL to other universities. These loans are identified via patron type, where the patron type is Borrow   Direct, or InterLibrary Loan. 

2. The second one provides a count of BD and ILL loans to  CUL from other universities. These loans are identified via material type, where the material type is Borrow   Direct, or InterLibrary Loan. 

The two queries MUST be run individually, as they provide two seperate tables.
