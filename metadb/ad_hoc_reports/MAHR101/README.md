# MAHR101: Davis Expenditures

**Approved Invoices with bib data (customized MCR134 for Rob Davis - vendor criteria, non-Asia materials)**

**Query writer:** Joanne Leary (jl41)  
**Last updated:** 1-21-25

This query is adapted from the MCR134 query, approved_invoices_bib_data. It has been customized for Rob Davis at Columbia University to 
show specific vendor criteria and to show non-Asia materials. It provides the list of approved invoices within a date range along with:
- Vendor name
- Finance group name
- Vendor invoice number
- Fund details
- Purchase order details
- Language
- Instance subject
- Fund type
- Expense class
- LC classification
- LC class
- LC class number
- Bibliographic format

In cases where the quantity was incorrectly entered as zero, this query replaces zero with 1.
