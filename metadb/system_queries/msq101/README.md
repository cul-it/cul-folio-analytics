# MSQ101 â€” Voyager Patron Data Removal

## Overview

This script, `remove_voyager_patron_ids.sql`, is designed to permanently remove patron identifiers and related data from specific tables in the **Metadb reporting database**. These tables were originally migrated from the **CUL Voyager legacy system** and contain static data.

Since the data is not expected to change, this script will be executed **once only** by the hosting team.
