MCR214B 
Physical_Item_Counts_incl_items_rec_but_not_yet_cataloged
Created by A&P in FY25 for counts for CU DFS (Division of Financial Services)

Brief description: With FY25, A&P uses this query each quarter to get volumes added counts for Cornell's 
Division of Financial Services. This query modifies MCR214 to include item records for titles recieved but not 
yet cataloged (whose call numbers include "%n process%"). MCR214 only includes counts of items cataloged and 
made ready for patrons' use. Since not all physical items are cataloged in the same year their item records are 
created, and MCR214 bases addition counts on item record creation dates, some additions are never included 
in the MCR214 addition counts (although all items are included in the held counts once cataloged). 
DFS does not need volumes added retrospectively counted separately; it's counts only need to be divided by 
contract vs. endowed.
