purchase requests with days elapsed till checkout 

This query finds the number of days between when a firm-ordered (one-time) fully-received item was ordered (item record created), then received at LTS, then received at the unit library and then first checked out (Folio only). If item was not discharged at the unit library upon receipt, or item did not have an "In process" status prior to discharge, time elapsed will show null. Includes bibliographic info, order info and fund information
can be limited to just requested purchases (un-comment out lines 108-109).
