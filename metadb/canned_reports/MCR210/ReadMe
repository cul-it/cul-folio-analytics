Changesfrom the LDP query:
	--hard-coded five item statuses for missing and lost; excluded non-regular collection material types (equipment, supplies, peripherals, laptops, keys, etc)
	-- added a separate subquery for ISSNs
	-- for "other library" holdings, excluded suppressed holdings
	-- removed item status filter; not needed for updated query
	-- put in wildcards and ilike for library parameter
