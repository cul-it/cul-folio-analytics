-- 10-1-22: This query finds expired patrons with open fines.
-- 8-24-23: applied distinct to query
-- 1-17-24: added home address
-- 1-31-24: re-writing in metaDB
-- 6-13-24: testing with large dataset from CIT; updated address fields to get CIT addresses and applied the coalesce function to choose the first non-null entry for CIT/Folio Home and Campus
-- 11-15-24: made corrections:
	-- join from ffa table to ffffa table is ffa.id = ffffa.account_id 
	-- added condition "__current = TRUE" to loant and ffa table; 
	-- return date comes from the ffffa table, not the loant table
