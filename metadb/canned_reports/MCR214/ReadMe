Physical Items Counts

This query provides item counts of physical materials, by format type. It excludes microforms, and, because of how we filter
for microforms, any motion pictures with '%film%' in their call numbers. This query is primarily used to get counts for 
annual CUL reporting.

Changes from LDP query:
This query links by location code instead of location name; automatically removes microforms by 007, and PDA/DDA not yet 
purchased; and was re-written to run faster, and to standardize and make more inclusive filtering values.

--Revised 9-11-25 to show owning library, endowed or contact college, and correct item counts; 
	-- replaced derived tables with source tables, added Where condition "item__t.hrid is not null" (line 107), corrected join to location__t.library_id = loclibrary__id
