MCR214
Physical Items Counts

This query provides item counts of physical materials, by format type. It excludes microforms, and, because of how we filter for microforms, any motion pictures with '%film%' in their call numbers. This query is primarily used to get counts for annual CUL reporting.

Changes from LDP query:
This query links by location code instead of location name; removes microforms by 007, and couttspdbappr not yet purchased.
