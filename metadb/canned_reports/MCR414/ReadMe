Materials circulated in Folio

This query finds all item records created after a given start date at a given library, and shows circ counts by year circulated (Folio loans only).
Note that all records migrated from Voyager will show a June 2021 create date. If you enter a begin date before June 21, 2021, all records in Folio (that meet the other criteria) will be displayed.
Results include LC class and class number, year of publication, publisher, language, subject and vendor (when known).
Lines 88 - 91 show holdings types and material types to exclude; query as written will show just books if more than just books are needed, comment out the necessary lines, so the other holdings and material types will be included.
This query is useful for analyzing collection usage over time. Export results to Excel and create pivot tables for analysis.
