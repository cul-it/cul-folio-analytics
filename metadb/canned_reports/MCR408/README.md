This query finds items accessioned at the Annex with an "In transit" status, using an imported file of barcodes.

## Notes
Please note that this query refers to the local_open schema to use data from a local table called "jake_sample_barcodes." <br>
This query can be modified to refer to a different local schema and to use data from a different local table if desired.

## Change Log
- 1-22-25: Updated query to use primary tables (not derived).
