773_and_899_aggr_counts_adc

For the annual data collection, this query get counts of e-aggregators and other e-collections coded in 773 and 899 fields, to help track
large changes in e-counts from year to year if needed. It merges the 773 and 899 counts, and sorts the counts in descending order. 
Excludes PDA/DDA titles unpurchased.
773 and 899 are repeatable, but the subfields used here appear not to be? There is overlap between some packages, so these are not 
intended for counts, but to try to help identify large changes with LTS assistance.
