MCR192
Volumes withdrawn or transferred

This query extracts holdings administrative note data to allow counts of physical items withdrawn by location AND to allow the identification of transfers that go from endowed to contract units, and vice-versa. These counts are used for volumes withdrawn figures needed by the Division of Financial Services each quarter.
It pulls fields like: the number of pieces withdrawn/transferred, the date, the originating library, the netid, processing unit, and contract/endowed college group.
(notes without ttype codes, or note with different ttypes are marked '0' for number of pieces)

IMPORTANT NOTES
This is a rethink of CR192, as CUL is now (as of mid-October 2024) using holdings administrative notes to track 
withdrawals and transfers, to get full location information (see the new LTS procedure 9: 
https://confluence.cornell.edu/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=317948999). A&P uses this query to get withdrawal 
counts for CUL, divided between contract and endowed, for CU's Division of Financial Services depreciation 
figures (supplied quarterly).

This version differs also in that: it uses leader0607 to limit transactions to those for print based physical
materials (those starting with leader0607s of a%,t%, c%, or d%); and removes items with locations of "serv,remo". 
It also pulls out the action type so the withdrawals and transfers can be counted separately.
The code here allows for the fact that there are a few cases of staff adding a space between "orig:" and the 
location code. You can use the Excel function statement below to remove any extra spaces.
Coding also allows for original location codes to have, or not have, commas in their codes.
The query strings together multiple holdings notes.

This query was first written with section 2 to assign contract college or endowed via location. Since then
we have added the field "dfs_college_group" to the "lm_adc_location_translation_table" so that section
is no longer necessary. Likewise MCR233 (used to update the location translation table) will be updated.

When data is pulled:
-Check to make sure no duplicates by holdings ID
-For action type "w", use pivot table to get the sum of items withdrawn by location and sum for endowed and for 
contract.
-For action type "t", use the following function statement to see if there were any transfers between endowed 
and contract:  =EXACT(UPPER(LEFT(SUBSTITUTE(H2," ",""),3)), UPPER(LEFT(SUBSTITUTE(T2," ",""),3))). It allows for
capitals in location codes, and removes spaces.
