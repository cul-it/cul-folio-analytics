MCR233
adc_location_translation_table.sql
updated 11/12/24 to include the new field added to assign locations to Contract College, Endowed, Not CUL, or Unknown
(dfs_college_group).

CR233 and MCR233 is used to help update the lm_adc_location_translation_table.  It pulls location code, location name, 
and shelving location names data from FOLIO’s inventory_locations and inventory_libraries tables, and corresponding 
data from the lm_adc_location_translation table. In Excel, one can then ensure the translation table data matches that 
from the FOLIO tables. Any needed updates can be made to the translation table, either through manual updates, or 
through reloading the translation table using data from this pull (see https://confluence.cornell.edu/x/yXSZGQ for info 
on uploading files). Any updates should also be made to CORE’s list of locations on Confluence:  
https://confluence.cornell.edu/x/yXSZGQ . These updates are Assessment & Planning’s (A&P’s) responsibility;  A&P checks 
locations quarterly. 

The query indicates which fields are to be retained for the translation table.
The lm_adc_location_translation_table will not be renamed with the date when updated to avoid having to update the 
table name in queries. Instead the update date is included in the table itself. Only the latest version of the table 
will be in shared schemas.

What to look for in the Excel output:
--are there location_create or location_updated dates after the last translation table check?
--are there any blanks in the ADC location translation fields?
--compare the location codes (in fields E and F), location names (G and H), and shelving location names (K and L)
   to see if they are the same. You can use the Excel EXACT function, e.g., "=EXACT(E2,F2)." If exact, 
   it will output "TRUE", if not "FALSE." Do the FALSES show blanks or textual differences?*
--on 3/4/24, there were 200 locations.


*We have decided not to add an accent to Nestle's name as it doesn't seem to work to import it to FOLIO even
if you follow these instructions: To add accent for Nestle: Insert; Symbols (on right); Symbol; scroll to letter 
needed (character code 00E9); click on the letter; click on insert; click on close.
