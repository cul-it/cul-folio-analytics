Voyager and Folio circ counts with parameters

This query finds total Voyager and Folio circ usage for given parameters: LC class, library, title, instance hrid and/or language.

NOTE: It's best to comment out any of the WHERE statement parameters that you're not using, or the query will take an eternity to run.
However, DO NOT comment out the "language ordinality" condition, even if you comment out the language_filter parameter.
