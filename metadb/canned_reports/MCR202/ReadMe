MCR202

This query finds purchase requests by fund code, location, library or fiscal year AND shows requester information, number of days FROM request DATE to receipt DATE, AND number of loans for that title (cannot get circulatiON informatiON at item level)

Changes from the LDP query:
  Updated query to point to po_instance table in folio_reporting schema
  Changed the requester condition to exclude variations of "na"
  Changed class number to TRIM the TRAILING dot AND cast result AS NUMERIC
  Added invoice_line_number, invoice_status, quantity AND invoice_payment_date to final subquery
  Changed total paid to remove the "sum" ON main.invoice_line_total (was erroneously increasing the paid amount)
  Got rid of "NUMERIC" casting ON lc_class_number (was making query fail when there were errors in call number formatting)
  Added library name AND location name to the final query (left out by mistake)
  Added fiscal year filter
  Added the derivations for po_instance AND instance_subjects AS subqueries, because those derived tables are currently     
  incorrect in Metadb (AS of 7-15-24)

-- 9-26-25 - fixed by eliminating null joins for instance ids; updated LC class extract (still not perfect)
-- 10-15-25: corrected total paid calculation (depends on fund_distribution_type, which was not accounted for previously -- see line 124) and lc_class_number
	-- sorting by title doesn't work for some reason - DBeaver deletes spaces between words and sorts the remaining characters alphabetically
-- 10-16-25: deleted po_instance derivation and instance_subjects derivation; replaced with derived tables; deleted reference to receiving note; 
	-- coalesced title occurrences (instance index title, instance title, po_instance title)
