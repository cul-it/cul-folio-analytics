# MCR195

## expense_transfer.sql

**Last updated:** 1-21-26

This query is a customization of CR-134 (paid invoices with bib data) for the purpose of identifying expenditures that can be transferred from unrestricted funds to restricted funds.

**Query writer:** Joanne Leary (jl41)

**Query reviewer:** Sharon Markus (slm5)

### Revision History
- **11-18-24:** Excluded restricted funds and certain funds that Ann indicated would never be used to transfer funds out of (line 203 and 204).
- **1-24-25:** Added instance UUID and replaced the derived tables with primary tables (added derivation code for `po_lines_locations`, `finance_transaction_invoices`, and `instance_languages`; used `instance__t` instead of `instance_ext`).
- **1-16-26:** Revised to use derived tables and simplify query, replaced the aliases with full table names; coalesced instance title with po_lines__t.title or package to get "title"; used Collate "C" for title sorting
- **1-16-26:** runs in under 2 minutes for FY2026 as of 1-16-26 

### Notes from the LDP Query
- **7-19-23:** Updated query to account for changes in subject extraction.
- **12-27-23:** Updated query for 2CUL funds that were switched into Area Studies fund group in FY2024; added fund 2352.
- **1-5-24:** Changed the subject extracts to use the `instance_subjects` derived table; aggregated subjects in main query rather than the subquery.
- **7-29-24:** Updated the fund sorting statement for Course Reserve funds folded into Interdisciplinary.
