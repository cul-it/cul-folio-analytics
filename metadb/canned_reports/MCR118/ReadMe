## MCR118 â€“ Missing in Transit

**Written by:** Joanne Leary (jl41)  
**Reviewed by:** Linda Miller (lm15) and Vandana Shah (vp25)  

### Description
This query finds items that are still in transit after 10 days and shows requesters and designated pickup locations.
This query does not use the derived table "users_groups" because that table is wrong.

## Change Log
**3-25-25:** updated to add "in transit destination service point name" since that is a separate field from request pickup destination; 
	-- updated last check in date to "timestamptz" (otherwise it was pulling the GMT date/time)
	-- updated size grouping formula to include "#" symbols, and for cases where the word "Oversize" appears without "+" symbols
**Updated:** 3-20-25
