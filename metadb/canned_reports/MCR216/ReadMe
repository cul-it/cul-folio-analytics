Unique Microform Title (Instance) Counts

This query provides counts of microform titles, by format type. Note that, because of how we filter for microforms,
it also includes any motion picture films with '%film%' in their call numbers. 
This query is primarily used to get counts for annual CUL reporting.

--Revised 12/20/25 to include joins to the records.lb table to exclude duplicate instance_ids due to a metadb glitch that is keeping some old as well as new record rows.
