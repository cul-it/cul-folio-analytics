Unique Microform Title (Instance) Counts

This query provides counts of microform titles, by format type. Note that, because of how we filter for microforms,
it also includes any motion picture films with '%film%' in their call numbers. 
This query is primarily used to get counts for annual CUL reporting; the data is also posted on a Tableau dashboard.

Changes from LDP query:
This query links by location code instead of location name; and was re-written to run faster, and to standardize and 
make more inclusive filtering values.
