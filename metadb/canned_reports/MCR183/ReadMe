MCR183

This query counts laptop circs and renewals by library, date, loan type, and laptop type (Mac or PC).  Also
counts how many laptops were used on any given day.  Please note that until the end of the academic year 
in 2022, Mann laptop loans were made through LibCal as well as FOLIO, and this report includes only 
FOLIO counts. As of the end of the FY22 academic year, all Mann laptop loans are in FOLIO. 
(see notes from annual data collection for more info.)

 Changes from LDP query: 

Replaced examples of libraries as some libraries don't have laptops.
Added to the query description that it also includes renewal counts, and indicates how many different laptops were used on any given day.

Updated to use Joanne Leary's new derived loans_renewals_dates table. Renewal counts still need to be summed.
Had to move the loan material type up as renewals can be repeated and material type is not.

This SQL will need to be updated as the new derived table is now temporarily in the local_shared schema until it is approved by the Reporting SIG. 
Two additional field name changes:  instance_hrid instead of hrid. and item_effective... instead of effective...
added distinct to count
Added "other" as a possibility of laptop type
