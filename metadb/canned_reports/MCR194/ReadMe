Checkouts and checkins by service point, material type, collection type and date range

This query finds checkouts and checkins by month for a given service point and date range. Item records that have been deleted will show a material type name of null. Because most deleted records are equipment records, these items have been categorized as "Equipment" collection type as a best guess.

  -- note that the action date is the field called "createdDate" at the end of the acl jsonb array
	-- updated from the LDP query to show material type name as well as collection type
	-- when item records from the circulation table are not found in the item table (because they were deleted some time after having circulated), 
	-- the assigned collection type is "equipment" because those types of records are most likely to have been deleted
