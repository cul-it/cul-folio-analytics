shelf_list_inventory_brief

This query finds shelf list inventory information by library location. The most_recent_patron_group field determines what patron group an item was assigned to most recently, 
which is important for assignments to the Borrow Direct and Interlibrary Loan patron groups, which change frequently. 

The Excel file that is produced in the query results maps to an Excel macro for further processing by Collection Management staff.

Note to users: Please contact the reporting team:
- If your library uses volume size designators other than "+" signs, or the words "Oversize" or "Tiny"
- If you have a special collection that is not assigned its own separate Folio location
We will customize this query to accommodate your collection designations or size indicators.

The fact that an item is boundwith should be noted in the whole call number.
Format is based on the item record material type id, not instance record format.
