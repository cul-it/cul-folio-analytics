# MCR226 
## funds_for_stewardship 

This query was modified from CR134 to better serve the needs of alumni affairs by providing information on stewarded funds. 
It generates a list of approved invoices within a specified date range and includes details such as the primary contributor's name, 
publisher name, publication date, publication place, vendor name, LC classification, LC class, LC class number, 
finance group name, vendor invoice number, fund details, purchase order details, language, instance subject, fund type, and expense class.

### Change Log
- **3-14-25**: Added `invoice_line_number`; set contributor ordinality = 1; added field050 ordinality = 1.
- **3-13-25**: Revised to specifically retrieve Endowment funds (fund_type like 'Endowment%') at line 362.
- **3-13-25**: Altered the fund type in the Where clause to be like 'Endowment%'.
- **3-3-25**: Joanne Leary overhauled all the derived tables with the code for those tables, replaced the “locations” subquery with the `po_lines_locations` derived table code, revised the subqueries for subjects and languages, updated the contributors subquery (eliminated unnecessary table joins), and introduced a subquery for field 902 (donor information in some instance records).
- **3-3-25**: Replaced derived tables with source tables; replaced "locations" subquery with the derivation code for `po_lines_locations`.
- **2-28-25**: Added field 902 subquery (shows p-fund donor).
- **1-21-25**: The 902 MARC field will be updated quarterly to display endowment purchases and to support the bookplate website (see Jenn); may require adding 902 to this query.
- **11-6-24**: Converted to Metadb, updated the contributor subquery and sorted funds.
- **12-20-23**: Modified and reviewed by Ann Crowley, Joanne Leary, and Sharon Beltaine.
