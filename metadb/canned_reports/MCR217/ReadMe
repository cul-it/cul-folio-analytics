Ematerial Title (instance) Counts

This query provides counts of ematerials, by format type. Formats are taken from 948 field, and if missing then taken
from the stat code, and if both these fields are missing, formats are taken from the MARC format code. Titles with 
multiple codes are assiged based on the priority listed in the CASE clause.
This query is primarily used to get counts for annual CUL reporting; figures are also posted on a Tableau dashboard.
(This query has never removed titles on order.)

Changes from LDP query:
This query was re-written to: link by location code instead of location name; directly remove PDA/DDA not yet purchased; 
run faster; make filtering more consistent/inclusive;  assign formats to e-resources with multiple format codes; prioritize 
counting databases and journals over books (when the reverse was true earlier); reassign a few codes to different formats; 
and add agg functions to the 948 and 899 subqueries. A few of these changes resulted in a significant decrease to the 
number of databases, and a small increase in the number of  electronic serial titles.
