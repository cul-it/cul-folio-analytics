Unique Instance Counts (physical materials)

This query provides counts of unique titles (instances) of physical items, by format type. It excludes microforms, 
and, because of how we filter for microforms, any motion pictures with '%film%' in their call numbers. 
This query is primarily used to get counts for annual CUL reporting; data is also posed to a Tableau dashboard.

Changes from LDP query:
This query links by location code instead of location name; automatically removes microforms by 007, and PDA/DDA not yet 
purchased; and was re-written to run faster, and to standardize and make more inclusive filtering values.
