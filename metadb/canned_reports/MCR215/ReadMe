Unique Instance Counts (physical materials)

This query provides counts of unique titles (instances) of physical items, by format type. It excludes microforms, 
and, because of how we filter for microforms, any motion pictures with '%film%' in their call numbers. 
This query is primarily used to get counts for annual CUL reporting.

--Revised 12/20/25 to include joins to the records.lb table to exclude duplicate instance_ids due to a metadb glitch that is keeping some old as well as new record rows.
