Annex_items_with_in_transit_status

This query uses a local file of barcodes, which are regularly uploaded to the ldp local schema by an annex staff member (currently Jake Barnard). Jake runs the query to double-check the newly accessioned items, to be sure they donâ€™t have an in-transit status. It is a collection maintenance query.
